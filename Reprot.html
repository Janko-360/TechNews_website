        <h1>Web Development Final Report</h1> 
        <h3>Student number: 210103328</h3>
        
        This report aims to inform the reader about all aspects regarding the website TechUP. The website is a 
        news-like website aimed at technology enthusiasts and intends to enable a similar community chat mechanisms 
        as Stack-overflow or Reddit. The Homepage will display reviews of the news articles. These previews then 
        link to the articles for in-depth reading and a discussion of thoughts at the end. As mentioned, the target 
        audience is the tech community. Providing discussion material for all technology related categories. The 
        discussion material will be written by verified and well-informed sources, this aims to prevent false news 
        and the like. 
        
        <h2>Inspiration</h2> 
        
        As the author of this website, I was primarily inspired by my love for the tech world and its wide range 
        of categories. Sine we are tasked with a news website, I took inspiration from the short tech news videos 
        found on YouTube. Examples include the channel TechLinked or Gamers Nexus . I wanted to provide relevant 
        news and enable a community like discussion on the topics at hand. That is where the communities of stack 
        overflow and reddit inspired me. And so, TechUP was born. 
        
        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        
        To ensure the enjoyment of all TechUP users. The site incorporates three accessibility aids. 
        <br> <br>
        First, a option to change the text size of the entire website. This empowers the user to adjust 
        according to reading or navigating comfort. The options include small, aimed to increase readability 
        on odd sized devises. Next is the default medium sized option with a comfortable text size and finally 
        a large text size to assist with visual or literate impaired individuals. As a result of this text changing 
        effort, the site took minor artistic defects. 
        <br> <br>
        Second, aid is a change in contrast. This feature switches between a colourful site and text to a grey 
        scale site. This drastically increases the contrast and helps the reader. 
        <br> <br>
        Finally, the focus highlighter. This feature toggles the tab selector to a thick and red outlined selector 
        or resets it to the default thin and grey selector. This will aid with navigating the web page with the tab 
        button.
        
        <h2>Usability</h2> 
        
        No site is popular without an excellent layout for ease of use. TechUp aims to achieve this by keeping a 
        classic and intuitive website structure, so people don’t have to study the layout and search for 
        functionality, everything is where they are used to having it. Next, we have adequate use of white space. 
        Elements on a page that need attention will get it by means of surrounding it with sufficient nothingness. 
        Finally, the site is designed to never have too much information or elements focused in one area. Allowing 
        a comfortable reading flow, everything relevant is grouped and well organised. 
        
        <h2>My learnings</h2>
        
        First and foremost, I’d like to credit W3Schools’ documentation and explanations. I spend a lot of time on 
        that website looking for new features, understanding them and figuring out why my code does not do as I need 
        it to. Especially with CSS and JS where the parameter combination or sequence is essential. 
        From that site I also learned the use of CSS variables and how to manipulate then with JS. This made the core 
        of the accessibility features. Also, the CSS background-blend ability. It helped a lot with correcting the 
        background image contrast to the foreground text.
        <br> <br>
        To use Handlebars to the fullest I studied a YouTube series by Mr. Finelli. In it he explained the fundamental 
        mechanics that allow extensive templating. I drew inspiration from his approach to use handlebars to generate 
        near limitless websites with only a database. He also showed a slightly different approach to render the 
        templates than what we were shown in class. Note, I could not copy his code since he implemented his with 
        JQuirey and my functionality drastically differs from his. All I did was copy his idea to template pages. 
        I used the class examples to get started and fundamentally adapted it from there.
        
        
        <h2>Good aspects</h2> 
        
        Things I think really worked well are the following. 
        The fundamental incorporation of handlebars. The way its functionality is built into the website allows for 
        several unique features. First, custom HTML. Since HTML code first gets compiled and then rendered means that 
        we can use the input data to uniquely identify content by using the data’s ID values. For example: the CSS IDs 
        and classes have values depending on its location in the database or passing custom values to the JS function 
        calls. This ability is the core to a templating approach that enables near limitless web pages that can be 
        generated with JS, Handlebars and the JSON database. As a matter of fact, with a few modifications to the 
        website code will it be possible to have as many article pages and article previews as there are database 
        entries. I really like this approach, let the computer do all the work for us. Unfortunately, due to the time 
        limit and project requirements, I was not able to fully implement such functionality. 
        <br> <br>
        Another thing that works well is how the comments get rendered on the article pages. The JSON database has a 
        nested comment structure and to ensure all comments get rendered I build a recursive function that obtains all 
        comments regardless of how deep they are nested. It uses handlebars to compile each comment individually and 
        adds the custom compiled code to a string variable. This string variable will then be used to populate the HTML. 
        <br> <br>
        Finally, the article preview scroll. On the home page we have a preview of all articles. When one hovers over 
        the article text it will slowly scroll up and show the main article text. At the end of the article the scroll 
        will stop. Then the user can either preview the next article, in which case the text locations will be reset 
        and ready for the next run. Or click on the article to go to the full article page. 
        
        <h2>Bad aspects and to improve</h2>
        
        Unfortunately, I could not spend enough time on CSS responsiveness. The site is responsive but not as much 
        as I’d hope to achieve. CSS not as straight forward as I hoped. After all there is a reason for all the CSS 
        memes. Also, I should have gone all in on the em unit approach, as shown in a webinar, or stick to the relative 
        unit approach from the start. 
        <br> <br>
        Another thing I wish to improve next time is better planning to incorporate accessibility features. 
        The change in text size gives me headaches with certain screen sizes.
        <br> <br>
        Ultimately, the good old problem of running time. The more time the better the functionality and content 
        of the website. Even though I am satisfied with the final result and time planning. There remain a few 
        features I wish to improve or add to have the website resemble the real counterparts.
