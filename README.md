# TechNews_website
My first full website project. 


This is the final project for the first Web-Dev semester. A Website of my own.
The Report.html page details the creation, aspects effort and self evaluation.  

Notable aspects:

- the website is not static, I used JSON to fill in data using the Handlebars library.
